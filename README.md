# Day Planner

## Description
This is a simple day planner that tracks day time from 9am to 5pm. It has colored timeblocks that tell the user whether time has past, is the time time, or 
if time is still in the future; grey represents time that has past, red represents the present, and green represents time in the future. It allows the user
to type in an event in a time block and save it to local storage by clicking the save button. It also allows the user to reset the calender by clicking the
reset button.
I created this project to help a user keep track of thier day. The features that this project presents are simple, however are effective when used effectively.
Creating this project taught me how to save and remove items from local storage. It also helped me to understand Moment.js more and that time is tricky to
program.


## Usage

To use day planner type into the input block to the right of each time block. To save information inputed in a time block click the save button and it will
save to local storage. You can do this for each time block.

To reset the calender click on the reset button at the top of the page.
